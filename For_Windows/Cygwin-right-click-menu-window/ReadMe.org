#+STARTUP: Cygwin Right Click Menu
#+TITLE: Cygwin Right Click Menu

1. Installation
When you install *Cygwin*
(or if you¡¯ve already installed it, download it again and start setup again to run an /update/), 
make sure that you select the =chere= package under the "_Shells_" category.
After *Cygwin* is launched, open up a *Cygwin* terminal (as an /administrator/) 
and type the command: chere -i -t mintty.
Now you should have ="Bash Prompt Here"= in the Windows _right-click_ context menu.

(*mintty* is *Cygwin*'s default terminal. If you don't choose it with the -t option, 
your "Bash Prompt Here" will use the same terminal as the Windows Command Prompt, 
which prevents horizontal resizing.)

2. Usage
To open sygwin in a particular folder, open the folder, right click, and select
=Bash Prompt Here= to open sygwin in that folder
